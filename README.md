# mlProject_Zine

This is the github repository for Machine Learning project under Zine.
Problem Statement: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AH6nDERVY4C37SLjrm1tlI0QWOdiOhQl/view

The objective of this project is to design and train a Machine Learning
system capable of detecting DeepFake (spoofed) voice samples and
distinguishing them from real human speech.
DataSet used: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/awsaf49/asvpoof-2019-dataset (ASVspoof 2019).

Note: this is the new repository under the same name "mlProject_Zine", i have deleted previous repository.

The project is based on Classical ML based Classifiers (Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and
Random Forest) and not on Deep Learning based Classifiers (CNN).

The ASVspoof 2019 dataset gives us two scenarios LA (Logical Access) and PA (Physical Access).

So far, for LA scenario I have implemented all three stages of problem statement, hence the Model has been completed and fully tested.
but for PA scenario i have fully wriiten the code for all three stages but due to very large no.(250K+) of audio files kaggle cannot process the audio files hence Model for PA cannot be completed and is in progress.
