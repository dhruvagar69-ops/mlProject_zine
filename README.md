# mlProject_Zine

This is the github repository for Machine Learning project under Zine.
Problem Statement: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AH6nDERVY4C37SLjrm1tlI0QWOdiOhQl/view

The objective of this project is to design and train a Machine Learning
system capable of detecting DeepFake (spoofed) voice samples and
distinguishing them from real human speech.
DataSet used: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/awsaf49/asvpoof-2019-dataset (ASVspoof 2019).

Note: this is the new repository under the same name "mlProject_Zine", i have deleted previous repository.
i have started using new repo because jupyter notebook was not able to handle the large no. of audio files.
The project the based on classic ml classifiers and not on deep learning.
